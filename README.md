## Project Name:  Car Price Prediction
## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to develop a car price estimation service that provides users with a reliable estimate of a carâ€™s current market value, requiring no login or sharing of sensitive information. The target users are individuals and car dealers.



## running the project
In the root of the git repo there is a notebook called Cars.ipynb with comments along the way for why we choose the techniques that we did. At the bottom of the notebook there is a block for a gradio application that you can run from the notebook and get a webpage. Alternatively all the codeblocks have been extracted to a python script that can be found in src/mlModel.py. When running this you should get a gradio webapp too, but it is a little slower.


## Business Objectives
* Optimize Pricing: Give a realistic price estimate to dealers and sellers.
* Support Investment Decisions: Help car dealers make good decisions when buying or selling a car.
* Simplify the Buying and Selling Process: A reliable price estimation.

## Business Impact
* Streamlined Decision-Making: Accurate price estimates offer dealers a market reflected pricing, which then speeds up the process of buying a car..
* Enhanced Market Positioning: Accurate price analysis.

## Comparison with Existing Solutions
The solutions we have today often require a long registration process and seem to only provide a general estimate. Our service will deliver price estimates based on car attributes.
## Manual Method for Price Estimation:
Machine learning helps us with price estimation which would normally require manually comparing cars with historical sale prices, which then could be very time consuming.

## Machine Learning and Software Metrics
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Root of the average of squared differences between predicted and actual car prices.
* Latency:The response time from user input to the return of estimate.
* Throughput: Number of price estimates per minute.

## Stakeholders
* Customers: Individuals and car dealers.
* Car Dealers: Car dealers who need a service for a more accurate price.

## Resources
* Personell:
Developers.
* Computational Resources:
Computers for development and cloud resources if needed.
* Data Resources:
Historical car prices and market trends.
## Data
This project uses training and test datasets. To ensure consistency and data quality, cross-validation is applied.
## Data Preprocessing:
* Missing Data Handling: Filled missing values in fuel_type, accident, and clean_title with default values. For numeric columns, iterative and simple imputers were used.
* Feature Engineering: Horsepower, displacement, engine_type, and cylinders from the enginecolumn and encoded categorical variables, such as brand and fuel_type, used Label Encoding.
* Scaling: Standardized continuous variables for better performance.

## Modeling
## Exploratory Data Analysis:
A heatmap and price distribution plots were used to get a better view of feature relationships. Correlations between model year, milage, and variables like accident and price indicated connections between vehicle age, mileage, and price.
## Model Selection and Optimization:
Random Forest Regressor was chosen as the primary model due to its performance with structured data. The optimized parameters achieved an RMSE of 66,035.47.
## Label Encoding:
Random Forest models are effective with label encoded data, which simplified the data representation without slowing our performance.
## Deployment
The model will be deployed via Gradio, providing a user-friendly interface. The goal is to maintain a fast response time.
## Summary
This car price estimation project utilized Random Forest Regressor as the model, achieving an RMSE of 66,035.47. Label Encoding was preferred over One-Hot Encoding for easier readability. The car price estimation service offers reliable price estimates for private users and dealers. The final deployment through Gradio offers a user-friendly experience with minimal latency.
